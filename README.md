## Challenge Insights

### Most Difficult Part

The most challenging aspect of this project was working with **NX monorepo and Angular**, especially setting up the workspace and managing shared libraries. Additionally, writing tests was a complex task since I had no prior experience with testing in Angular and NX monorepos.

### Easiest Part

The easiest part of this challenge was working with **SCSS styling**. Since I already have experience with SCSS, implementing styles and structuring components was straightforward.

## ADDITIONAL NOTE

- If you encounter any issues while setting up the project, ensure that you have the correct versions of **Node.js and Angular CLI** installed.
- The project follows a modular structure with **NX workspace**; if any library fails to load, check the path and module dependencies.
- Test cases are currently a work in progress, and improvements will be made in future iterations.
